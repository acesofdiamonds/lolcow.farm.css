# lolcow.farm.css
This is my contribution to help Rom with the CSS from 16chan's Lynxchan fork. The point it to make it look like 
the old version of lolcow.farm which is running ? Tinyboard?

Anyway, you may want to mess with the css which styles the threads. 
>filesize colors and font size is incorrect to the spirit of the original site


>I couldn't find the catalog background color/threads pages background color 


>I didn't mess with the catalog colors at all, sorry I ran out of time 

This should get you close enough. I hope it was helpful.
